Testing out [aframe.io](https://aframe.io/) with [d3.js](http://d3js.org). use **WASD** keys to "walk" around the space.

Since AFrame works with DOM elements, you can use d3's selection API to generate and modify 3D elements, as well as handle "mouse" events (including the VR friendly "fuse cursor") as if it was SVG.
